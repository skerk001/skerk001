# Hi, I'm Samir Kerkar 👋

**Clinical Data Analyst** | **Aspiring Data Scientist**

I work at the intersection of healthcare analytics and machine learning — analyzing EHR data across 60,000+ patients and 20+ facilities to drive measurable improvements in clinical outcomes. I build tools and models that turn messy, real-world data into actionable insights.

## 🔬 What I'm Working On

- **[Courtside](https://github.com/skerk001/courtside-NBA)** — Full-stack NBA statistics platform with custom-derived advanced metrics (Win Shares, BPM, VORP) built from the mathematical formulas
- **[Diabetic Retinopathy Classification](https://github.com/skerk001/diabetic-retinopathy-classification)** — CNN-based severity grading of retinal fundus images (F1 = 0.94)
- **[Gene Expression Cancer Prediction](https://github.com/skerk001/gene-cancer-prediction)** — ML classification of AML vs. ALL leukemia subtypes using high-dimensional RNA expression data (F1 = 0.95)

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

**Languages:** Python, SQL, R, JavaScript/TypeScript  
**ML/DS:** scikit-learn, TensorFlow/Keras, pandas, NumPy, SciPy, matplotlib, Plotly  
**Engineering:** FastAPI, React Native, PostgreSQL, Redis, Git  
**Healthcare:** EHR/EMR systems, clinical data pipelines, outcomes research, causal inference  

## 📊 By the Numbers

- **$83.50 PMPM** cost reduction identified in COPD intervention analysis (p = 0.0027, n = 997)
- **0.94 F1** on 5-class diabetic retinopathy classification from retinal images
- **0.95 F1** on gene expression cancer subtype prediction (7,000+ features)
- **4+ years** of ML and analytics experience in healthcare

## 🎓 Education

**B.S. Mathematics** (Mathematical Finance) — University of California, Irvine
