## 📌 What is Courtside?

Courtside is a full-stack NBA analytics platform built around three proprietary impact metrics that evaluate every player in NBA history on a unified scale. Unlike traditional box-score aggregators, Courtside uses **era-adjusted z-score normalization**, **machine learning for historical gap-filling**, and **position-interpolated regression coefficients** to produce fair cross-era comparisons.

> *"How do you compare a 1962 Wilt Chamberlain season to a 2024 Nikola Jokić season? The same way — by measuring how far each deviated from their peers, adjusting for era inflation, and weighting by context."*

## ⚡ The PMI System

The **Player Metric Index (PMI)** is a composite rating that measures overall player impact on a standardized scale. It decomposes into offense and defense, supports regular season and playoffs independently, and is complemented by a clutch-specific variant.

| Metric | What It Measures | Scale |
|--------|-----------------|-------|
| **PMI** | Total player impact (OPMI + DPMI) | ~0 to +12 |
| **OPMI** | Offensive impact (scoring, efficiency, playmaking) | ~0 to +10 |
| **DPMI** | Defensive impact (stocks, rebounds, ML-imputed for pre-73) | ~0 to +5 |
| **CPMI** | Clutch Performance Metric (last 5 min, ±5 pts) | ~0 to +11 |
| **AWC** | Accumulated Win Contribution (PMI × minutes × constant) | Cumulative |

## 🧮 Mathematical Framework

### OPMI — Offensive Player Metric Index

For each player-season, raw box-score stats are converted to **within-season z-scores**, ensuring fair cross-era comparisons. The OPMI is a position-interpolated weighted sum:

```
OPMI_raw = Σ w(pos, stat) · clip(z_stat, -3.0, +3.0)
```

where the weight function interpolates between guard and center coefficients based on estimated position:

```
w(pos, stat) = (1 - t) · w_guard(stat) + t · w_center(stat)
    where t = (pos - 1) / 4    (PG=1, C=5)
```

**Guard Coefficients (PG/SG):**
| Component | Weight | Description |
|-----------|--------|-------------|
| `z_pts` | 1.05 | Scoring volume vs peers |
| `ts_diff` | 10.0 | True shooting % above league average |
| `z_ast` | 0.70 | Assist rate vs peers |
| `z_tov` | −0.60 | Turnover penalty |
| `z_orb` | 0.15 | Offensive rebounding |
| `z_fta` | 0.10 | Free throw drawing |
| `z_fg3m` | 0.10 | Three-point volume |

**Special Adjustments:**

```
Volume Gate:     ts_diff *= clip((z_pts + 1.0) / 2.0, 0.25, 1.0)
Center Floor:    z_pts = max(z_pts, -0.3 × max(0, (pos - 2) / 3))
Playmaker TOV:   z_tov *= (1 - min(0.30, (z_ast - 1.0) × 0.12))  if z_ast > 1.0
Era Penalty:     OPMI *= era_multiplier(season)
```

### DPMI — Defensive Player Metric Index

```
DPMI_raw = w_stl · z_stl + w_blk · z_blk + w_drb · z_drb + w_pf · z_pf
DPMI = DPMI_raw × scale × 0.72    (dampener prevents defense from dominating)
```

### Pre-1973 ML Imputation

The NBA didn't track steals or blocks before 1973. We train a **GradientBoostingRegressor** on post-1973 data to impute DPMI for historical players:

```python
Features:  trb_rate, pf_rate, team_win_pct, mpg, is_center, era
Target:    Known DPMI from post-1973 seasons
Model:     GradientBoosting(n_estimators=200, max_depth=4, lr=0.08)
```

An additional **elite historical defender boost** applies to pre-73 centers with dominant rebounding rates and exceptional team success:

```
boost = min(1.8, (trb_rate - 0.35) × 8.0 × (team_win% - 0.500) × 3.0)
```

### Era Stat-Inflation Penalty

Older eras had fewer teams, pace inflation, and weaker competition pools. A graduated penalty is applied to OPMI:

![Era Penalty](docs/assets/era-penalty.png)

</div>

### Career Aggregation

Career PMI uses a **peak-weighted average** that reduces longevity dilution — your best seasons count more than decline years:

```
weight_i = sqrt(rank_from_best)
    where season ranked 1st gets weight √N, 2nd gets √(N-1), ..., worst gets √1

career_PMI = Σ(w_i · PMI_i) / Σ(w_i)
```

This is then **Bayesian-regressed** toward the league mean based on games played:

```
trust = GP / (GP + GP_HALF)       GP_HALF = 60 (regular) | 10 (playoffs)
final_PMI = trust × career_PMI + (1 - trust) × league_mean
```

## 🔥 CPMI — Clutch Performance Metric Index

A PMI-like composite built entirely from NBA clutch splits (last 5 minutes, score within ±5 points). Separate calculations for regular season and playoffs.

```
CPMI_raw = 1.50·z_ppg + 0.40·z_apg + 0.35·z_ts + 0.50·z_plusminus
         + 0.15·z_spg - 0.35·z_tovpg + volume_bonus

volume_bonus = clip((clutch_ppg - 1.5) × 0.4, 0, 1.5)
```

## 🏆 Playoff PMI

Playoff evaluation uses a modified formula that emphasizes **scoring dominance** and reduces defensive weight — because in the playoffs, getting buckets wins series.

**Key differences from regular season:**
- `z_pts` weight: 1.05 → **1.20** (scoring matters more)
- DPMI dampener: 0.72 → **0.48** (offense-first evaluation)
- **Scoring dominance bonus**: elite z_pts (>2.5) with good efficiency gets an OPMI kicker
- GP regression half-trust: 60 → **10** games (169 playoff GP ≈ 94% trust)
